*Still need to download all libraries
*rotate images that went on their side
*make a .js file



Troubleshoot:

****Arrow turns into vertical line for text entry when it hovers over sections with text.
(I think this happened when I got the text and images in 'education section' originally "about section"

****having trouble downloading libraries (the right ones and the right version- typ of code)

****making full screen images fit as big as possible





Git Resdtore just saved me a lot of work decoding something I messed up but didn't know where
